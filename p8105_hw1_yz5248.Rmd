## Problem 1: Dataset Description

The `early_january_weather` dataset comes from the **moderndive** package and contains hourly weather data collected at LaGuardia Airport (LGA) in early January 2013.

This dataset has **`r nrow(early_january_weather)`** rows and **`r ncol(early_january_weather)`** columns.  
Key variables include:

- `time_hour`: date-time object indicating the hour of observation  
- `temp`: temperature in Fahrenheit  
- `humid`: relative humidity  
- `wind_speed`: wind speed in mph  
- `precip`: precipitation in inches  
- `visib`: visibility in miles  

The mean temperature during this period was **`r round(mean(early_january_weather$temp), 1)` Â°F**.
